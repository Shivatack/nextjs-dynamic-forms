This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project used as a [Medium tutorial](https://medium.com/@ayoub.azaroual/dynamic-forms-using-next-js-9bdba495c34f) to demonstrate how to use server actions with toasts to create a dynamic form.

## Getting Started

First, install node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
